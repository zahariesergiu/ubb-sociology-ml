        "Requirements\n",
        "\n",
        "- Create a NN regression model on the Census dataset, with 'hours-per-week' target\n",
        "\n",
        "- Model Selection and Setup:\n",
        "    - Build a neural network model using a deep learning library like TensorFlow, Keras or PyTorch.\n",
        "    - Choose a loss (or experiment with different losses) for the model and justify the choice.\n",
        "        - MSE, MAE, RMSE, Huber Loss or others\n",
        "    - Justify model choices based on dataset characteristics and task requirements; specify model pros and cons.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "- Data Preparation\n",
        "    - Use the preprocessed datasets from Task 1.\n",
        "    - From the train set, create an extra validation set, if necesarry. So in total there will be: train, validation and test datasets.\n",
        "    - Be sure all models have their data preprocessed as needed. Some models require different, or no encoding for some features.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "- Model Training and Experimentation\n",
        "    - Establish a Baseline Model:\n",
        "        - Train a simple NN model with default settings as a baseline.\n",
        "        - Evaluate its performance to establish a benchmark for comparison.\n",
        "    - Make plots with train, validation loss and metric on epochs (or on steps), if applicable.\n",
        "    - Feature Selection:\n",
        "        - Neural Networks can learn feature importance automatically, so all relevant features should be included rather than manually selecting a subset.\n",
        "        - Consider using embeddings for high-cardinality categorical features instead of one-hot encoding to improve efficiency.\n",
        "    - Experimentation:\n",
        "        - Focus on preprocessing techniques rather than manually selecting feature combinations. Ensure numerical features are normalized (e.g., MinMaxScaler, StandardScaler) and categorical features are properly encoded (e.g., one-hot encoding or embeddings for high-cardinality variables).\n",
        "        - Experiment with different neural network architectures (e.g., number of layers, neurons per layer) and hyperparameters (e.g., activation functions, learning rates, dropout rates, and batch sizes).\n",
        "        - Use techniques such as early stopping and learning rate scheduling to optimize model performance and prevent overfitting.\n",
        "        - Identify the best model which have the best performance metrics on test set.\n",
        "    - Hyperparameter Tuning:\n",
        "        - Perform hyperparameter tuning only on the best-performing model after evaluating all model types and experiments.\n",
        "        - Consider using techniques like Grid Search for exhaustive tuning, Random Search for quicker exploration, or Bayesian Optimization for an intelligent, efficient search of hyperparameters.\n",
        "        - Avoid tuning models that do not show strong baseline performance or are unlikely to outperform others based on experimentation.\n",
        "        - Ensure that hyperparameter tuning is done after completing feature selection, baseline modeling, and experimentation, ensuring that the model is stable and representative of the dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "- Model Evaluation\n",
        "    - Evaluate models on the test dataset using regression metrics:\n",
        "        - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)\n",
        "        - Mean Squared Error (MSE)\n",
        "        - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)\n",
        "        - R² Score\n",
        "    - Choose one metric for model comparison and explain your choice\n",
        "    - Compare the results across different models. Save all experiment results into a table.\n",
