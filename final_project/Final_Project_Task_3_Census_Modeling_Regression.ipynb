        "- You can use models (estmators) from sklearn, but feel free to use any library for traditional ML. \n",
        "    - Note: in sklearn, the LinearRegression estimator is based on OLS, a statistical method. Please use the SGDRegressor estimator, since this is based on gradient descent. \n",
