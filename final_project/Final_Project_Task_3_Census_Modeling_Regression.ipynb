MAE (Mean Absolute Error) deoarece stim deja ca datele prezinta outliers( doar o ora lucrata sau 99, venituri prea mari sau prea mici), aceasta metrice fiind mai robusta la valorile atipice. Ne va spne cu cate ore greseste modelul in medie pe saptamana, fara a distorsiona rezultatele din cauza cazurilor de ore extreme de munca lucrate. Ma voi uita si la RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) deoarece readuce eroarea la aceeasi unitate de masura ca variabila target (orele), dar, spre deosebire de MAE, pastreaza sensibilitatea fata de erorile mari si este utila pentru a vedea daca modelul are \"scapari\" majore pe anumite segmente de date.

        "In urma primei generari, putem observa ca modelul random forest a obtinut cele mai bune rezultate, aducand imbunatatiri fata de media simpla a datelor. MAE (7.393) ne arata ca modelul are o marja de eroare de aproximativ 7 ore si 20 de minute in numarul de ore lucrate pe saptamana. Totusi, precizia acestui rezultat nu este mare, ceea ce ne indica faptul ca, acest model mai de graba a aproximat orele, in loc sa fie exact. R squared ne indica faptul ca modelul reuseste sa explice 22.4%, un scor destul de mic, din variatia orelor de munca in functie de variabilele date. Avand in vedere MAE al Baseline, daca comparam celelalte modele, toate prezinta o valoare mai mare. Acest lucru ne arata faptul ca toate mpdelele acestea se complica inutil si dau rezultate negative. Faptul ca valoarea MAE este de 7 ore, iar MSE este peste 115, confirma prezenta valorilor extreme care afecteaza rezultatele. Valoarea RMSE este mai mare cu cel putin 3 unitati fata de MAE, ceea ce ne indica faptul ca modelul face greseli de predictie importante pe care nu le poate explica inca, in cazul Random forest eroarea fiind de aproximativ 11 ore. Comparativ cu media, modelul a reusit sa imbunatateasca rezultatul cu aproximativ 2 unitati, reducand astfel din greseli.\n",
