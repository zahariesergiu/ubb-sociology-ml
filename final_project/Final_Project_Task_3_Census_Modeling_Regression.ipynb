        "Pruning (Exp 3): Limiting the Decision Tree depth to 10 significantly improved generalization. It stopped the tree from creating specific rules for every single person.\n",

        "Reason: RMSE is in the same units as the target variable (hours). If the RMSE is 11.5, it means our predictions are, on average, \"off\" by about 11.5 hours. Unlike MAE, RMSE penalizes large errors more severely, which is important here because we don't want to wildly mispredict someone's livelihood.\n",

        "\n",
        "Polynomial Features: For the linear models (SGD), adding interaction terms (e.g., Age * Education) could help them capture non-linear patterns without needing a tree model.\n",
